# BlackJack Game in C#
This is a project BlackJack Game for the OOP module. Program should represent a simulation of real-life game called Black Jack featuring multiplayer, choosing player's budget and much more...
## Gameplay 
At the start of the game you are prompted with options to choose the main attributes of the game. More specifically you can choose the number of players, the size of the deck, min and max bet and player's budget.

After submitting your choices you will be moved straight to the actual game. There you will be prompted to choose the the amount you want to bet for your first round. **Now it is your time to shine**. You find yourself in a match against a dealer. You only have three options either hit, stand, or surrender. You can stay defensive and opt to stand the round or you can try your luck and you ask for a hit. After being satisfied with your current hand it is time to see the results!

Whether satisfied with the results or not you have now completed one round of the game. If you wish to continue you can continue to play or go back to the menu to alter the options.

## Algorithm behind the scene
Before any code was written it was essential to come up with the algorithm for the actual game and flow of the program. All of the flowcharts that make the base of the algorithm are provided below

## Coming soon...
As this was a school project I did not have much time to implement all of the features included in the flowcharts and the actual code. There is really no time for slacking in the third semester :). However I'm planning to expand on this project since it is overlapping with my other project in C#. I will try to focus more on the unfinished features and hopefully I will have a full-blown Black Jack game with all the bells and whistles. 
##Special Thanks
I have to thank our lecturer [keithmcmanus](https://github.com/keithmcmanus) for the amazing CA2 topic. I really enjoyed the time developing this project and hopefully it will look good on my GitHub account.
